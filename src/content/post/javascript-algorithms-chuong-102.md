In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data
type (ADT) — or data structure implementing this ADT—that
simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value
and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as
a set of linked nodes.

A tree data structure can be defined recursively (locally)
as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where
each node is a data structure consisting of a value,
together with a list of references to nodes (the _children_),
with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none
points to the root.

A simple unordered tree; in this diagram, the node labeled 3 has
two children, labeled 2 and 6, and one parent, labeled 2. The
root node, at the top, has no parent.
