When the order doesn't matter, it is a Combination.

When the order does matter it is a Permutation.

_My fruit salad is a combination of apples, grapes and bananas_
We don't care what order the fruits are in, they could also be
_bananas, grapes and apples_ or _grapes, apples and bananas_,
its the same fruit salad.

## Combinations without repetitions

This is how lotteries work. The numbers are drawn one at a
time, and if we have the lucky numbers (no matter what order)
we win!

No Repetition: such as lottery numbers `(2,14,15,27,30,33)`

Number of combinations

![Formula](https://www.mathsisfun.com/combinatorics/images/combinations-no-repeat.png)

where `n` is the number of things to choose from, and we choose `r` of them,
no repetition, order doesn't matter.

It is often called _n choose r_ (such as _16 choose 3_). And is also known as the Binomial Coefficient.

## Combinations with repetitions

Repetition is Allowed: such as coins in your pocket `(5,5,5,10,10)`

Or let us say there are five flavours of ice cream:
`banana`, `chocolate`, `lemon`, `strawberry` and `vanilla`.

We can have three scoops. How many variations will there be?

Let's use letters for the flavours: `{b, c, l, s, v}`.
Example selections include:

- `{c, c, c}` (3 scoops of chocolate)
- `{b, l, v}` (one each of banana, lemon and vanilla)
- `{b, v, v}` (one of banana, two of vanilla)
