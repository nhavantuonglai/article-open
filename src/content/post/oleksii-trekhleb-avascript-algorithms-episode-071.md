When the order doesn't matter, it is a Combination.

When the order does matter it is a Permutation.

_The combination to the safe is 472_. We do care about the order. `724` won't work, nor will `247`.
It has to be exactly `4-7-2`.

## Permutations without repetitions

A permutation, also called an “arrangement number” or “order”, is a rearrangement of
the elements of an ordered list `S` into a one-to-one correspondence with `S` itself.

Below are the permutations of string `ABC`.

`ABC ACB BAC BCA CBA CAB`

Or for example the first three people in a running race: you can't be first and second.

Number of combinations

```
n  (n-1)  (n -2)  …  1 = n!
```

## Permutations with repetitions

When repetition is allowed we have permutations with repetitions.
For example the the lock below: it could be `333`.

Number of combinations

```
n  n  n … (r times) = n^r
```
