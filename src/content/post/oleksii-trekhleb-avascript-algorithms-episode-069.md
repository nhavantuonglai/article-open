A [Palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
This means that the second half of the string is the reverse of the
first half.

## Examples

The following are palindromes (thus would return `TRUE`):

```
- _a_
- _pop_     ->  p + o + p
- _deed_    ->  de + ed
- _kayak_   ->  ka + y + ak
- _racecar_ ->  rac + e + car
```

The following are NOT palindromes (thus would return `FALSE`):

```
- _rad_
- _dodo_
- _polo_
```
