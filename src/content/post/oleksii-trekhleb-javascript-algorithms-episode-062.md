The longest common substring problem is to find the longest string (or strings) that is a substring (or are substrings) of two or more strings.

## Example

The longest common substring of the strings `ABABC`, `BABCA` and `ABCBA` is string `ABC` of length 3. Other common substrings are
`A`, `AB`, `B`, `BA`, `BC` and `C`.

```
ABABC
|||
BABCA
|||
ABCBA
```
