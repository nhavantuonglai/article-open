The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to some limit `n`.

It is attributed to Eratosthenes of Cyrene, an ancient Greek mathematician.

## How it works

1. Create a boolean array of `n + 1` positions (to represent the numbers `0` through `n`)
2. Set positions `0` and `1` to `false`, and the rest to `true`
3. Start at position `p = 2` (the first prime number)
4. Mark as `false` all the multiples of `p` (that is, positions `2  p`, `3  p`, `4  p`â€¦ until you reach the end of the array)
5. Find the first position greater than `p` that is `true` in the array. If there is no such position, stop. Otherwise, let `p` equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 4

When the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining `true` in the array are all the primes below `n`.

An improvement of this algorithm is, in step 4, start marking multiples of `p` from `p  p`, and not from `2  p`. The reason why this works is because, at that point, smaller multiples of `p` will have already been marked `false`.

## Complexity

The algorithm has a complexity of `O(n log(log n))`.
