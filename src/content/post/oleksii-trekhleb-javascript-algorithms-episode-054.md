The Knuth – Morris – Pratt string searching algorithm (or KMP algorithm) searches for occurrences of a _word_ `W` within a main _text string_ `T` by employing the observation that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient information to determine where the next match could begin, thus bypassing re-examination of previously matched characters.

## Complexity

  - Time: `O(|W| + |T|)` (much faster comparing to trivial `O(|W|  |T|)`)

  - Space: `O(|W|)`
