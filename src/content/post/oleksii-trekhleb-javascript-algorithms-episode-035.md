In computer science, a graph is an abstract data type
that is meant to implement the undirected graph and
directed graph concepts from mathematics, specifically
the field of graph theory

A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly
mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together
with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an
undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a
directed graph. These pairs are known as edges, arcs,
or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows,
directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines
for a directed graph. The vertices may be part of
the graph structure, or may be external entities
represented by integer indices or references.
