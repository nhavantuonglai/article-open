In computer science, a trie, also called digital tree and sometimes
radix tree or prefix tree (as they can be searched by prefixes),
is a kind of search treeâ€”an ordered tree data structure that is
used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys
are usually strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the
tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its
position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated.
All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string
associated with that node, and the root is associated with the
empty string. Values are not necessarily associated with every
node. Rather, values tend only to be associated with leaves,
and with some inner nodes that correspond to keys of interest.
For the space-optimized presentation of prefix tree, see compact
prefix tree.
