A [Palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
This means that the second half of the string is the reverse of the
first half.

## Examples

The following are palindromes (thus would return `TRUE`):

```
  - _a_
  - _pop_     ->  p + o + p
  - _deed_    ->  de + ed
  - _kayak_   ->  ka + y + ak
  - _racecar_ ->  rac + e + car
```

The following are NOT palindromes (thus would return `FALSE`):

```
  - _rad_
  - _dodo_
  - _polo_
```
