In number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive integer `n`, also called an integer partition, is a way of writing `n` as a sum of positive integers. Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same partition. For example, `4` can be partitioned in five distinct ways:

```
4
3 + 1
2 + 2
2 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1
```

The order-dependent composition `1 + 3` is the same partition
as `3 + 1`, while the two distinct compositions `1 + 2 + 1` and `1 + 1 + 2` represent the same partition `2 + 1 + 1`.

Young diagrams associated to the partitions of the positive
integers `1` through `8`. They are arranged so that images under the reflection about the main diagonal of the square are conjugate partitions.
