In mathematics, a matrix (plural matrices) is a rectangular array or table of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns. For example, the dimension of the matrix below is `2 × 3` (read _two by three_), because there are two rows and three columns:

```
| 1  9 -13 |
| 20 5 -6  |
```

An `m × n` matrix: the `m` rows are horizontal, and the `n` columns are vertical. Each element of a matrix is often denoted by a variable with two subscripts. For example, <i>a<sub>2,1</sub></i> represents the element at the second row and first column of the matrix

## Operations on matrices

### Addition

To add two matrices: add the numbers in the matching positions:

The two matrices must be the same size, i.e. the rows must match in size, and the columns must match in size.

### Subtracting

To subtract two matrices: subtract the numbers in the matching positions:

### Multiply by a Constant

We can multiply a matrix by a constant (the value 2 in this case):

### Multiplying by Another Matrix

To multiply a matrix by another matrix we need to do the [dot product](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors-dot-product.html) of rows and columns.

To work out the answer for the 1st row and 1st column:

Here it is for the 1st row and 2nd column:

If we'll do the same for the rest of the rows and columns we'll get the following resulting matrix:

### Transposing

To _transpose_ a matrix, swap the rows and columns.

We put a _T_ in the top right-hand corner to mean transpose:
