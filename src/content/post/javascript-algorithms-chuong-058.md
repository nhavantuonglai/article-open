In computer science, linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched.
Linear search runs in at worst linear time and makes at most `n` comparisons, where `n` is the length of the list. ![Linear Search](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/linear_search.gif)

## Complexity

Time Complexity: `O(n)`   - since in worst case we're checking each element
exactly once.
