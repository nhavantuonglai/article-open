The shortest common supersequence (SCS) of two sequences `X` and `Y` is the shortest sequence which has `X` and `Y` as subsequences.

In other words assume we're given two strings str1 and str2, find the shortest string that has both str1 and str2 as subsequences.

This is a problem closely related to the longest common subsequence problem.

## Example

```
Input:   str1 = _geek,_  str2 = _eke_
Output: _geeke_

Input:   str1 = _AGGTAB,_  str2 = _GXTXAYB_
Output:  _AGXGTXAYB_
```
